		Question 5 - Findings
**********************************************************************

To start with it is important to have a definition of difficulty.
By defining difficulty as the (average) amount of time it takes to
solve a Sudoku puzzle I find the following results:

Mystery1: A Sudoku board of “extremely hard” difficulty,
Mystery2: A Sudoku board which is actually impossible to solve,
Mystery3: A Sudoku board of “hard” difficulty.

I also count the number of recursions it takes to solve every Sudoku
board. One should expect that this number is positively correlated
with our other measure of difficulty, named duration. My results
verify this speculation. Mystery1 does 421,547 recursions to solve the
puzzle, while Mystery3 needs 14,134 recursions to solve the
puzzle. Mystery2 is unsolvable. Hence, this result further supports my
classification of the Mystery boards according to the level of their difficulty.

However, a striking result arises when I also test for the duration
and the number of recursions of the ‘medium’ puzzle. I find that
‘medium’ puzzle takes longer and needs more recursions to solve the
puzzle than Mystery3 which has been classified as of “hard”
difficulty. A possible reason for that is the search algorithm I use to solve
the Sudoku puzzles. I have employed a backtracking algorithm starting
from the top left corner of the board. The algorithm skips the
pre-supplied cells and checks all the remaining cells for a valid
number, moving back when there is a violation and moving forward again
until the puzzle is solved. Eventually the algorithm either fails to
reach the end of the board (puzzle unsolvable) or completes all cells
and terminates by reaching the end of the board. One can think that
starting from the top left corner is quite arbitrary and choosing a
different starting position might be more efficient in solving some
puzzles. Therefore, I decided to re-solve the puzzles starting from the
four different corners of the board. In that way, we can get a more
objective and robust measure of difficulty. Consequently, I solve
every Sudoku board 4 times starting from a different corner every time
and I collect the duration (in microseconds) and the number of
recursions it takes to solve each Sudoku board every time. I then
compute the average of these measurements for every Sudoku board. The
results are illustrated in the following table:


	   	Average Duration (microseconds)     Average Recursions		 
Mystery1	     98,420		                143,040
Mystery2	     ------ 	         		 ------
Mystery3	     54,157			         69,004
Medium		      8,175			          9,635
Easy		      2,957				  2,973


Based on the table results I classify the Mystery boards as follows:

Mystery1: A Sudoku board of “extremely hard” difficulty,
Mystery2: A Sudoku board which is actually impossible to solve,
Mystery3: A Sudoku board of “hard” difficulty.
